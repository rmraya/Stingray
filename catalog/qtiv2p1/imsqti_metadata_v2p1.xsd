            XSD Data File Information
            -------------------------
            Author:         Colin Smythe
            Date:           12th May, 2012
            Version:        2.1
            Status:         Final Release
            Description:    This is the Platform Specific Model of the Metadata object in the IMS QTI v2.1 Specification 
                            Information Model. It is this representation that is used to produce the XSD binding for the 
                            Metadata IMS QTI v2.1.

            History:        This version supercedes the full IMS QTI v1.2 and QTIv2.0 specifications.
